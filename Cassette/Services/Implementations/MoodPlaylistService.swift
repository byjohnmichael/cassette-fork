/// Tracks come from the server's own MOOD/genre/BPM tags, so the feature exists on every server.
///
/// Modelled on WrappedPlaylistService: a cadence marker in UserDefaults, playlists owned by the
/// server, and atomic replacement through createPlaylist's replace mode. The differences that
/// matter:
///
/// - **Five independent units of work.** A mood that fails keeps its old playlist and its old
///   marker, so the user still has last week's Workout rather than an empty one, and it retries by
///   itself. Nothing is ever cleared on failure.
/// - **Sequential, not parallel.** Instant Mix taught us that concurrent similarity queries on a
///   self-hosted box contend hard — eight parallel calls each took 22s against 12.8s solo. Five
///   moods one after another is friendlier and, on that evidence, probably not slower.
